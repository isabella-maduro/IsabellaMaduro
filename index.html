    <h2>Biography</h2>
            
            <blockquote>
                Emily Dickinson was born December 10, 1830, in Amherest Massachusetts, USA. She has been credited as 
                "America's greatest and most orginial poets of all time".<cite>Poetry Foundation</cite>
                She attended Mount Holyoke Female Seminary for South Hadley, for a year. Her brother Austin attended law
                school and became an attorney lived nearby with his wife Susan Gilbert. Emily had a younger sister named 
                Lavina who lived at home with Emily and her parents. Her father Edward Dickinson was 
                involved in state and national politices, serving in Congress for a term.

            <blockquote>
                <div>
                Emily Dickinson took definition as her province and challenged the existing definitions of poety and the 
                poet's work. She experimented with expression in order to free it from convential restraints. Crafted a 
                new type of persona for the first person. The speakers in her poetry are sharp-sighted obserbers who see 
                the inescapable limitations of their societies as well as their imagined and imaginable escapes. She created
                in her writing a distinctively elliptical language for expressing what was possible but not yet realized.

            <blockquote>
                <div>
                Her first volume of poetry was published in 1890, four years after her death on May 15, 1886. This release
                was met with lots of success. The first volume went throuhg 11 editions in less than two years, and
                were able to extend far beyond their first household audieces. She is now known as one of the most important 
                American poets, and her poetry is widely read among people of all ages.
