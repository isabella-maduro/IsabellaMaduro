                    <div>
                        Emily Dickinson was born December 10, 1830, in Amherst, Massachusetts, USA. She has been credited as "America's greatest and most original poets of all time". <cite>Poetry Foundation</cite> She attended Mount Holyoke Female Seminary for South Hadley, for a year. Her brother Austin attended law school and became an attorney who lived nearby with his wife Susan Gilbert. Emily had a younger sister named Lavinia who lived at home with Emily and her parents. Her father Edward Dickinson was involved in state and national politics, serving in Congress for a term.

                        Emily Dickinson took definition as her province and challenged the existing definitions of poetry and the poet's work. She experimented with expression in order to free it from conventional restraints. Crafted a new type of persona for the first person. The speakers in her poetry are sharp-sighted observers who see the inescapable limitations of their societies as well as their imagined and imaginable escapes. She created in her writing a distinctively elliptical language for expressing what was possible but not yet realized.

                        Her first volume of poetry was published in 1890, four years after her death on May 15, 1886. This release was met with lots of success. The first volume went through 11 editions in less than two years, and were able to extend far beyond their first household audiences. She is now known as one of the most important American poets, and her poetry is widely read among people of all ages.
